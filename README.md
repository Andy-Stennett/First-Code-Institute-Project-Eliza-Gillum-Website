These files were originally developed with Notepad as Codeanywhere wasn't working and I had to get something down on paper, so to speak. I've since downloaded and am using Visual studio for windows but the downside is that the versions are not recorded in Github, only the lates files as I upload them. This isn't a great solution but it's all I have at present. At least VS allows me to speed up the workflow.

Ok, this has been done late in the day as Codeanywhere decided to back up at an unfortunate moment, when I was already strapped for time. In any case, right about now I will upload the files I have just in case I get a repeat of the glitch I had this morning which destroyed several hours work and left me having to re-invent the wheel as well. Later verions and additonal pages will be added as I complete them. 

So, the mission, apart from producing a first project, is to help a friend out and build a website for her fledgeling business as a wellness coach. The copy is written by her, with the occasional minor edit by me. The photos were taken by both of us, mine aren't that great because I shot them in a gym in low light without flash so as not to disturb the other users of the gym. I was promised it would be empty but it wasn't. Life goes on. 

Anyway, first task is to get files on here so, must get cracking.





You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
